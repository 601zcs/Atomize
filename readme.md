# Atomize!
## Split your spectrometer apart

A modular open source software for working with scientific devices and combining them into a spectrometer.<br/>
The general idea is close to FSC2 software developed by Jens Thomas TÃ¶rring, http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~jtt/fsc2.phtml.<br/>
The liveplot library based on pyqtgraph is used as a main graphics library. The liveplot was developed by Phil Reinhold, https://github.com/PhilReinhold/liveplot

### Status: early in development
